        <p>
          Born and raised in Brittany (🇫🇷), I started my studies with a bachelor of international management
          specialized in marketing and sales from Rennes School of business. Through various experiences I found out I
          am particularly interested in business development and the design of new products.
          I am naturally drawn to the cosmetics and fashion sector in which I would like to work.
          After my master of global management in Tongji University, China, I now continue my studies with a master's
          degree in digital marketing and innovation from Ieseg.

          <p>I did a marketing internship for
            Veracova Skincare in Shanghai, a brand focused on the naturalness and transparency of their products.
            For them, I was responsible for implementing the marketing plan and its planning. I also developed their
            online promotional offers through the implementation of targeted advertising just as I managed the
            loyalty and affiliate program. In addition, I was in charge of a more B2B management of their
            partnerships and analyzed the results of these actions.
            I finaly participated in the development of new products / packaging 🇨🇳
